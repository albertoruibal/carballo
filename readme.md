Carballo Chess Engine
=====================
[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/albertoruibal/carballo.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#albertoruibal/carballo)

Carballo (the galician word for Oak, it's all about search trees) is an Open Source Java chess engine with three interfaces:

* UCI: a text interface for chess GUIs: https://github.com/albertoruibal/carballo/raw/master/carballo-uci-1.8.tgz
* HTML5: developed with Google Web Toolkit (GWT) using the Vectomatic SVG library: http://www.mobialia.com/webchessgwt
* Desktop: a swing application

It is organized into modules:

* Core: the chess engine
* Jse: the Java Standard Edition version with the UCI interface and JUnit tests
* Gwt: components needed for the GWT GUI
* GwtGui: an HTML5 interface developed by Lukas Laag, it depends on Core and Gwt
* Swing: the swing application code, it depends on Core and Jse

It is licensed under GPLv3 and the source code is hosted at https://github.com/albertoruibal/carballo.
You are free to use, distribute or modify the code, we ask for a mention to the original authors and/or a link to our pages.
